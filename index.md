# CPSC120 L Labs 

Lab 4
I enjoyed this lab because it was fun calculating weights. Especially since i calculated a variety of celebrities for fun. It was interesting seeing how people calculate their calories or even doctors do using this equation or perhaps a similar one. It was a relatively easy lab as well which is why I enjoyed it too.

Lab 7 Part 1
I enjoyed this lab because we got to use coding for a very real world scenario. It could also be created into some sort of website for the Government in order to allow people to check if there is parking allowed on a certain street. The lab was a bit challenging which made the feeling of completing it better.

Lab 12
I enjoyed this lab as we got to make a gif. I never knew the process for makign gifs so elarning how it wokred and how to make it was interesting. I now know how to make my own gifs, which can be useful in the future. Overall a very enjoyable lab.
